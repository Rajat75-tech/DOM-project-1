# Styled Div with JavaScript

This project demonstrates how to dynamically style a `div` element using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The example shows how to modify properties such as background color, text color, font size, margin, padding, height, width, and text alignment of a `div` element.

## Project Overview

In this project, we use HTML to structure a `div` element, CSS for initial styling, and JavaScript to modify the styles dynamically. This project covers:

- **HTML**: Creating the structure for a `div` element with text.
- **CSS**: Providing initial styling for the `div` element.
- **JavaScript**: Dynamically manipulating the `div`'s style properties to change its appearance.

## Features

- **HTML Structure**: Defines the `div` with the ID `targetDiv` that will be manipulated.
- **CSS Styling**: Sets basic styles for the `div`, such as background color, font size, margin, padding, etc.
- **JavaScript DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically alters the `div`'s styles when the page is loaded.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure that you have the following:
- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text) for viewing and editing the files.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

### Explanation of Files

- **index.html**: Contains the basic HTML structure and links to the external CSS and JavaScript files.
- **styles.css**: Defines the initial style of the `div` element (e.g., yellow background, text color, font properties).
